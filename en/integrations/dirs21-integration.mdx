## DialogShift Integration with DIRS21

The integration between DialogShift and DIRS21 enables hotels to access real-time availability and pricing information from the DIRS21 One engine.

The integration pulls availability, inventory, and pricing data directly from your DIRS21 booking engine, allowing DialogShift's AI assistants to answer guest inquiries with up-to-date information about room availability and rates.

<Info>
  **Coming Soon:** A full booking process based on DIRS21 One will be enabled for both Chat AI and Phone AI, allowing guests to complete reservations directly through these channels.
</Info>

### Usage

The data from DIRS21 is currently used for:

- **Chat Dialog Quickbooker** - Availability queries and bookings directly in chat
- **Phone Availability Info v1 and v2** - Room availability for phone inquiries

### How it Works

  <Step title="Availability and Pricing Data">
    DialogShift retrieves real-time availability, pricing, and rate information from the DIRS21 One engine. This data is used by Chat AI and Phone AI to provide guests with precise information about available rooms and current rates

### DIRS21 Directory (optional)

### Booking Engine Version

The Booking Engine version is preset and does not need to be adjusted. If in doubt, the ONE version can be selected.
