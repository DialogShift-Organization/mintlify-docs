### OnePageBooking - The Booking Engine

</Card>


## DialogShift Integration with HNS

The integration between DialogShift and Hotel Net Solutions provides a comprehensive connection that enables hotels to:

1. **Measure Revenue Impact** - Track and analyze the direct revenue generated through chat and phone services
2. **Real-time Availability & Pricing** - Access live inventory, availability, and pricing information from the HNS OnePageBooking engine

The integration pulls availability, inventory, and pricing data directly from your HNS booking engine, allowing DialogShift's AI assistants to answer guest inquiries with up-to-date information about room availability and rates.

<Info>
  **Coming Soon:** A full booking process based on OnePageBooking will be enabled for both Chat AI and Phone AI, allowing guests to complete reservations directly through these channels.
</Info>

### Usage

The data from HNS is currently used for:

- **Chat Dialog Quickbooker** - Availability queries and bookings directly in chat
- **Phone Availability Info v1 and v2** - Room availability for phone inquiries
- **Complete Booking Workflow** - From Q1 2026

    HNS activates a special tracking system that identifies bookings supported by DialogShift services
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reporting">
