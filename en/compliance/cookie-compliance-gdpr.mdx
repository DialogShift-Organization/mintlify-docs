</Info>

## Available Configurations

DialogShift provides two options for cookie compliance, each with different advantages and disadvantages:

    href="#integration-of-website-chat-into-the-website-cookie-management"
  >
    Integration of the chat into your existing website cookie management
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="DialogShift Managed Consent"
    icon="shield-check"
    href="#dialogshift-manages-cookie-consent-for-the-chat-widget"
  >
    DialogShift manages cookie consent independently
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Integration of Website Chat into the Website Cookie Management

With this configuration, the hotel integrates the DialogShift chat widget into the existing cookie consent management of the website.

<Note>
  The standard approach is that the website consent manager only loads our program libraries when the user has consented to functional (or marketing) cookies.
</Note>

### Advantages

<Steps>
  <Step title="Measurable Performance">
    Evaluation of chat opening rate possible
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Analytics">
    User behavior scoring is possible
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Disadvantages

<Warning>
  A significant portion of users will not see the chat offer on the website as they decline cookie consent.
</Warning>

## DialogShift Manages Cookie Consent for the Chat Widget

With our own cookie consent management, our solution initially does not set any cookies.

<Info>
  Only when the user starts a live chat is cookie consent requested within the chat itself. DialogShift directly requests the consent. Integration into the website consent management is not required.
</Info>

### Advantages

<Steps>
  <Step title="Maximum Reach">
    All website visitors can use the chatbot, regardless of their cookie settings on the website
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Disadvantages

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Limited Analytics">
    The chat opening rate cannot be calculated as no tracking cookies are set before interaction
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No Behavior Scoring">
    User behavior scoring is not allowed as long as there is no explicit consent
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Recommendation

<Tip>
  The choice between the two options depends on your specific requirements:
  - Choose **Website Integration** if detailed analytics are important
  - Choose **DialogShift Managed Consent** if maximum accessibility is a priority
</Tip>
