<Info>
From **August 2, 2026**, users must be informed when they interact with an AI system, as required by the EU AI Act (Art. 50). Chatbots and AI assistants fall into the **"limited risk"** category – the lowest regulated tier.
</Info>

## What is happening?

From **August 2, 2026**, the transparency obligations of the EU AI Act take effect. This applies to all channels: **webchat, phone AI, WhatsApp, and social media**.

This is exclusively about **transparency** – not about bans or extensive compliance requirements.

## What is DialogShift doing?

As the **provider**, the primary obligation lies with us. We are implementing the requirements technically – you don't need to handle this yourself:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Chat AI">
    AI notice in the default greeting and a permanently visible label in the chat window – multilingual
  </Step>
  <Step title="Phone AI">
    Clear announcement at the beginning of the call that an AI assistant is responding – already active today
  </Step>
  <Step title="WhatsApp & Social Media">
    AI notice in the first message
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
These measures will be rolled out **before the August 2026 deadline** for all customers.
</Tip>

## What do you need to do as a hotel?

Your effort is minimal:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your greeting text">
    If you have customized the default text, make sure the AI notice is preserved
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update your privacy policy">
    Add a brief section about chatbot/AI usage – we will provide a template text
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check your DPA">
    Ensure that a Data Processing Agreement with DialogShift is in place (already the case for most customers)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## In a nutshell
